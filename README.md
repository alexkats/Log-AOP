# What is it about
This is a little library, which could be used for logging spring beans in application. You can annotate any method or class with @Log annotation. In the latter case all public methods of annotated class will be logged. Logging is made via slf4j library. Entry and exit messages are logged for each method together with the execution time. You can also see some examples and tests in this project.
